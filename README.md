Mutation Analysis Tool
======================

This website is a portal for researchers to analyse their gene sequence.
Mutation is the only one being supported right now.

The project runs on PHP and mySQL as the backend.

Change the variable in 'headers/variables.php' to your own database configuration.
Then run 'db/createdb.php' to create the database to have the project up and running.
